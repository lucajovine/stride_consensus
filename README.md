# stride_consensus
This python script takes as single argument an output file generated by the secondary structure assignment program STRIDE ([PMID 15215436](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15215436/) ; https://webclu.bio.wzw.tum.de/stride), compares the secondary structure assignments for multiple copies of the same protein and generates a combined sequence and average secondary structure profile.

If the starting set of coordinates contains information for different proteins, the corresponding ATOM lines should be separated into multiple files before running STRIDE and then analyzing its output with stride_consensus.
 
The secondary structure codes (SSCs) output by the program match those of STRIDE:
 
<b>H</b> = Alpha helix  
<b>G</b> = 3-10 helix  
<b>I</b> = PI-helix  
<b>E</b> = Extended conformation  
<b>B</b> (or b) = Isolated bridge  
<b>T</b> = Turn  
<b>C</b> = Coil  
 
In addition, the consensus secondary structure profile generated by the program will contain <b>S</b> or <b>l</b> (lowercase L) SSCs for residues whose assignments are tied between H, G, I, E or B, T, C, respectively.
